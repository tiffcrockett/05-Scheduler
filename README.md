## Description

In the hustle and bustle of busy work days, it is necessary for business owners and employees to manage their time effectively.  The Work Day Scheduler is an application that allows users to plan and schedule work day tasks. This application runs in the browser, features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and is responsive for mobile and desktop devices.

The Work Day Scheduler is simple to use.  The user inputs a task in a input field next to the corresponding time of the event.  The entered tasks persist when the application reloads. The mobile-first feature of the Weather Dashboard makes it useful to users on-the-go.  

The current design is flat.  Aesthetic enhancements would be future improvements the application.  Expanding the timeblocks to include hours before and after the normal work day hours of 9a - 5p, would make the application useful for planning all events and activities, not just work-hour events, and would make it more practicalfor everyday use.
